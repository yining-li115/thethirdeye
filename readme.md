# 3D Detection Pipeline with YOLOE + Depth-Anything-3

This project implements a lightweight 3D detection and reconstruction pipeline by combining **YOLOE** (real-time object detector) and **Depth-Anything-3** (state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation model).

The system takes an RGB image as input, detects objects using YOLOE, predicts the depth map using Depth-Anything-3, and fuses them to produce 3D-aware visualizations and simple scene reconstructions. A **FastAPI** server is used to expose the pipeline as a web API.


This combined model has been tested and **runs successfully on Python 3.10**.

## ✨ Features

- **Object detection** powered by **YOLOE**
  - Fast and accurate detection
  - Supports common object categories
  - Can be installed directly via:
    ```bash
    pip install ultralytics
- **Depth estimation** using **Depth-Anything-3**
  - High-quality monocular depth
  - Supports any indoor/outdoor scenes
  - Installation instructions should follow the official repository:
    https://github.com/ByteDance-Seed/Depth-Anything-3
- **3D Fusion**
  - Combine YOLO bounding boxes with depth for pseudo-3D object localization
  - Generate colored point clouds (RGB + depth)
  - Export `.ply` and `.npy` scene data
- **FastAPI backend**
  - HTTP API endpoints for running detection + depth in one request
  - Easy to integrate with other services or a frontend
